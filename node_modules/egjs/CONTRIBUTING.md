## Style Guide

egjs has several style guidelines to follow.
Before your start, please read attentively below instructions.

### Linting
We adopted [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) to maintain our code quality. 
All rules are described at [.jshintrc](.jshintrc) file.

### Code Convetions
To maintain same code style across entire project, we adopted [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) as code style checker.
All conventions are described at [.jscsrc](.jscsrc) file.

### Commit Log Guidelines
egjs use commit logs in many different purposes (like creating CHANGELOG, ease history searching, etc.).
To not break, you'll be forced to follow our commit log guidelines.
Before your commit/push, make sure following our commit log guidelines.

The outline is as below:
```
<type>(<module>): <subject>

```

- **Types**
  - **feat**: A new feature
  - **fix**: A bug fix
